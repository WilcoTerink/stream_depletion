Welcome to the documentation of stream_depletion
================================================

**stream_depletion** is a Python package that can be used to evaluate the stream depleting effects of pumping
a well at a rate :math:`Q_w(t)`. The analytical solutions as provided by :cite:`Theis1940` only allow for the estimation of
the stream depletion effect under a constant pumping rate for duration :math:`t`.   

By combining i) the analytical solutions as described by :cite:`Theis1940`, and ii) the 'superposition' principle, this package makes it
possible to evalute the stream depletion effect as a result of a pumping regime that can be dynamic (variable pumping rates) over time.
